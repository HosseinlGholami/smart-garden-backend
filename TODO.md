## 📝 Notes for Developers

### 🚨 Before Starting Development
1. **Set up development environment** following README instructions
2. **Review current codebase** to understand existing patterns
3. **Check for existing implementations** before creating new features
4. **Follow coding standards** defined in the project
5. **Write tests** for all new functionality

### 🔍 Important Considerations
- **Mock data system** is implemented - ensure real API integration doesn't break it
- **Role-based permissions** are partially implemented - complete them consistently
- **Docker services** have dependencies - ensure proper startup order
- **Environment variables** need validation and documentation

### 🤝 Collaboration Guidelines
- **Create feature branches** for all new work
- **Write comprehensive commit messages** following conventional commits
- **Update documentation** when adding new features
- **Test thoroughly** before creating pull requests
- **Review code** with team members before merging
